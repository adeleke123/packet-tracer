## Networking Packet Tracer

This repository showcases my activities at the Cisco Networking Academy, focusing on enhancing my expertise in cybersecurity. Below, I have outlined two specific activities that I have worked on:

### Packet Tracer - Create a Simple Network:
In this activity, I utilized Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool, to design and implement a basic network infrastructure. I set up different network devices such as routers, switches, and end devices, and configured their respective IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. Additionally, I established connectivity between these devices, ensuring seamless communication within the network.

### Packet Tracer - Creating a Cyber World:
During the "Packet Tracer - Creating a Cyber World" activity, I utilized Packet Tracer to construct a simulated cyber environment where I focused on implementing several security measures to safeguard the network against potential threats. The activity consisted of various parts, each involving the configuration of different servers and services. Here is an overview of what I accomplished:

`Part 1: Configure the FTP Server`
In this section, I configured an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server to facilitate secure file transfers within the network. I established user accounts, defined access permissions, and ensured that data transfers were encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

`Part 2: Configure the Web Server`
For the web server configuration, I set up a secure environment for hosting websites. I implemented SSL/TLS certificates, enabled HTTPS, and applied security best practices to protect the server and its hosted content from potential cyber threats.

`Part 3: Configure the Email Server`
In this part, I configured an email server to facilitate secure communication within the network. I implemented secure protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) with TLS encryption, ensured proper authentication and access control, and implemented measures to prevent spam and other email-based threats.

`Part 4: Configure the DNS Server`
To ensure secure and reliable DNS (Domain Name System) resolution, I configured a DNS server. I established proper zone configurations, implemented secure DNS protocols such as DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions), and applied access control policies to protect against DNS-related attacks.

`Part 5: Configure the NTP Server`
For accurate time synchronization within the network, I configured an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. I ensured that the NTP server was securely configured to prevent potential attacks or unauthorized time modifications, thus maintaining the accuracy and integrity of time synchronization.

`Part 6: Configure the AAA Server`
In this section, I configured an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server to centralize user authentication and access control. I defined user profiles, implemented strong authentication mechanisms, and enforced access policies to enhance network security and monitor user activities.

Throughout the activity, I implemented security best practices, considered potential vulnerabilities, and applied appropriate security controls such as firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and virtual private networks (VPNs) to protect the network infrastructure from unauthorized access and potential cyber attacks.


Please note that these activities represent only a subset of my work at the Cisco Networking Academy, and I have engaged in numerous other exercises and learning modules to further develop my cybersecurity skills.
